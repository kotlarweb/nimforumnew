Content license
===============

All the content contributed to $hostname is `cc-wiki (aka cc-by-sa)
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`_ licensed, intended to be
**shared and remixed**.

The cc-wiki licensing, while intentionally permissive, does require
attribution:

**Attribution** — You must attribute the work in the manner specified by
the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse
you or your use of the work).

This means that if you republish this content, you are
required to:

* **Visually indicate that the content is from the $name**. It doesn’t
  have to be obnoxious; a discreet text blurb is fine.
* **Hyperlink directly to the original post** (e.g.,
  https://$hostname/t/186/1#908)
* **Show the author names** for every post.
* **Hyperlink each author name** directly back to their user profile page
  (e.g., http://$hostname/profile/Araq)

To be more specific, each hyperlink must
point directly to the $hostname domain in
standard HTML visible even with JavaScript disabled, and not use a tinyurl or
any other form of obfuscation or redirection. Furthermore, the links must not
be `nofollowed
<http://googleblog.blogspot.com.es/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html>`_.

This is about the spirit of fair **attribution**. Attribution to the website,
and more importantly, to the individuals who so generously contributed their
time to create that content in the first place!

Feel free to remix and reuse to your heart’s content, as long as a good faith
effort is made to attribute the content!
